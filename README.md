#MySQL Studies
This repository is dedicated to my studies about MySQL. It is divided into five folders, each one covering a specific topic about MySQL. The folders are:

- DDL (Data Definition Language): covers the commands used to define and manipulate the structure of a database such as creating tables, indexes, and constraints.

- DML (Data Manipulation Language): covers the commands used to manipulate data in a database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records.

- DQL (Data Query Language): covers the commands used to retrieve data from a database, such as SELECT statements, joins, and subqueries.

- Relational Model: covers the theory behind the relational model and how it relates to MySQL databases.

#Getting Started
To run the scripts, you will need to have MySQL installed on your machine. You can download the MySQL Community Server <a href='https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/'>here</a>.
